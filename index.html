    <h2>What is CSS?</h2><br>
    <ol class="work">
        <li>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.</li>
        <br>
        <li>CSS describe how HTML element are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media.</li>
        <br>
        <li><span style="text-decoration: line-through; background-color: white;">Css is not necessay </span> <span>CSS 
            saves a lot of work.</span> It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once</li>
        <br>
        <li style="text-decoration: underline;">External stylesheets are stored in CSS file.</li>
        <br>
    </ol>
<h2>CSS can be added to HTML document in 3 ways:</h2>

<ul class="space">
    <li>Inline - by using the style attribute inside HTML elements1</li>
    <li>internal - by usinng a style element in the head section</li>
    <li>External - by using a link element to link to an external CSS file.</li>
   <li>The most common way to add CSS, is to keep the styles in external CSS files. However, <span>in the tutorial we 
    will use inline and internal styles,</span> because this is easier to demonstrate, and easier for you to try 
    it yourself.</li>
</ul>

<p>
    When comparing CSS class vs ID, the difference is that CSS class applies a style to multiple elements. ID. on the 
    other hand, applies a style to one nique element. ID is also special in that you can use a special in that you can 
    use a special URL  to link directly to an element and it's used by JavaScript. 
</p>
<p>
    In CSS, selectors are used to target a specific element or range of elements on a web page. Once an element has been targeted,
    a style or set of styles can be applied to the elements. 
</p>
<p>
    There is wide range of selectors available. Two of the most commonly used are class and ID. Both are used to target
    element to which a style should be applied.
